# Pages

The `pages` folder is a crucial component in a typical web application structure. It contains individual page components that make up the user interface (UI) of the application.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `pages` folder is to organize and store the UI components of the application, such as the login page, dashboard, settings, and more. Each page component is typically a self-contained unit that represents a single view or screen in the application.

## Structure

The `pages` folder usually contains subfolders or files that correspond to specific pages or features in the application. For example:

* `login.js`: The login page component.
* `dashboard.js`: The dashboard page component.
* `settings.js`: The settings page component.
